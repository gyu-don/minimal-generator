# minimal-generator

`minimal-generator` is a source code example that demonstrates the implementation of generators in the Rust programming language. This code is provided as open source and can be reused, but it is intended as a minimal configuration for understanding the implementation. For actual production use, it is recommended to use the [`genawaiter`](https://docs.rs/crate/genawaiter/latest) library instead.

## Overview

The `minimal-generator` code provides a basic implementation of generators in Rust, showcasing how they can be used to create the generator. It includes a simple example that generates a sequence of Fibonacci numbers using a generator.
